## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

If you don't install ruby gems yet. Install it!
* [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) - RubyGems package management framework for Ruby

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

We need install the Bundler from RubyGems
```sh
gem install bundler
```

### Running

After the bundler was installed, we need to run the bundle for fetch the dependencies
```sh
bundle install
```
Ok, now we need run the Jekyll Server too
```sh
jekyll serve
```
If you need a watcher:
```sh
jekyll serve --watch
```
The watcher will built everything, after each change :)
